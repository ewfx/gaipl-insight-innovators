KB001,High CPU Usage,Performance,"CPU consistently above safe threshold, often due to heavy load or code inefficiencies",Investigate processes; optimize application logic; consider scaling resources
KB002,Memory Leak Detection,Memory,System memory usage grows steadily over time indicating a possible leak,Use profiling tools to trace memory allocation; restart app to reclaim memory
KB003,Database Connection Timeout,Database,"DB connections are timing out, possibly due to network or DB load",Check DB health; inspect connection pool settings; retry with backoff
KB004,Authentication Issues,Security,Failed login attempts or expired sessions may indicate brute-force attacks,Enable MFA; lock accounts after threshold; investigate login sources
KB005,Service Startup Logs,Operations,Logs confirming successful service startups are useful for audits,No action needed unless inconsistent with deployment expectations
KB006,Queue Monitoring,Scalability,Monitoring job or task queue depth ensures system scalability,Alert on queue length; autoscale consumers if needed
KB007,Configuration Errors,Configuration,Invalid or missing configurations cause application to misbehave,Validate config files; apply fallback defaults
KB008,Disk Full Conditions,Storage,Applications failing due to lack of disk space,Clean temp files; rotate logs; increase disk size
KB009,Application Crashes,Stability,Unhandled exceptions leading to crashes,Improve error handling; fix null references or data validation
KB010,System Health Checks,Monitoring,Automated health checks ensure services are alive and responsive,Ensure all critical services have health check endpoints
KB011,Temperature Threshold Alerts,Hardware,High CPU temperature could signal thermal throttling,Improve cooling; review hardware utilization
KB012,Scheduled Maintenance Events,Maintenance,System restarts or downtimes during maintenance windows,Notify users in advance; monitor service recovery
KB013,Thread Pool Tuning,Performance,Proper sizing of thread pools avoids under/over-utilization,Tune thread count based on CPU cores and workload
KB014,Log Rotation Issues,Logging,Failure to rotate logs can fill disk and impact performance,Use logrotate or similar tools with retention policies
KB015,Service Latency,Performance,High response times may signal backend delays,Investigate dependencies; add caching; monitor latency
KB016,SSL Handshake Failures,Security,SSL errors could result from invalid certs or mismatched protocols,Renew certificates; enforce TLS versions
KB017,Security Alerts,Security,Unauthorized access attempts detected in logs,Audit logs; restrict IPs; enable intrusion detection
KB018,System Reboot Events,Hardware,Unexpected reboots may indicate hardware or kernel issues,Check hardware logs; patch kernel; run diagnostics
KB019,Deadlocks in DB Transactions,Database,Deadlocks can occur when resources are locked indefinitely,Use deadlock detection; optimize transaction order
KB020,NullReference Exceptions,Development,Crashes due to uninitialized variables or null objects,Add null checks and default values in code
KB021,Service Discovery Failures,Networking,DNS resolution failures can interrupt service-to-service communication,Check DNS config and network access
KB022,Cache Hit/Miss Logging,Performance,Helps monitor efficiency of cache layers,Review cache strategy if hit ratio is low
KB023,Retry Logic on Failures,Resilience,Some operations should retry safely on transient failures,Implement exponential backoff with caps
KB024,Latency Monitoring,Observability,Keep track of service latencies under varying loads,Set SLOs; trigger alerts on P95/P99 spikes
KB025,Backup and Snapshot Events,Recovery,Regular backups ensure quick disaster recovery,Verify backups; automate snapshot scheduling
